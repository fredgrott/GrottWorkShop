## Is the Mike on?

Well, its my first post testing my new blog setup as I do not think Posterous will be up that much 
longer with Twitter buying the engineer staff. Typically this blog will cover mobile application 
development but there will be some mixing in of start-up culture, the mobile OEM and operator 
industries, and general hacking up new tools and products.

Its a shame about Posterous as I as beginning to like the service and it had some very nice un-invading
social aspects to it as a social service. Of course I also liked friendfeed long before the major feature 
changes as it really was an alternative to twitter for longer conversations.
